# AbadIA-MCP: An AI Agent for "The Abbey of Crime"

## Overview

This project implements an AI agent that can play and solve the classic video game "The Abbey of Crime" (La Abad√≠a del Crimen). It uses a Model Control Program (MCP) server to interface with the game and a sophisticated agent to make decisions and navigate the game world.

## Features

*   **MCP Server:** A robust server that provides a clean interface for interacting with the game. The server exposes the following tools:
    *   `move_to_location`: Moves the character to a named location.
    *   `investigate_location`: Investigates a named location.
    *   `talk_to_character`: Initiates a conversation with a character.
    *   `get_full_game_state`: Gets the complete current state of the game.
    *   `send_game_command`: Sends a single, low-level command to the game.

*   **AI Agent:** An intelligent agent with capabilities for:
    *   Pathfinding
    *   Object interaction
    *   Puzzle solving
    *   Following the game's narrative
    *   The primitive tools must be provided by the MCP server
    *   Planning differents strategies based in the game context.

*   **Real-time Game State Monitoring:** The agent has access to the complete and real-time state of the game.

*   **Extensible Architecture:** The project is designed to be modular, allowing for the easy addition of new skills and behaviors to the agent.

## Architecture

The project's architecture is centered around a "smart" server and a "strategic" agent, which communicate with each other.

### MCP Server (The "Smart" Driver)

The MCP server has evolved beyond a simple bridge. It now exposes a set of **high-level commands** through its RESTful API. Instead of just handling low-level inputs (like 'UP' or 'DOWN'), the server now understands complex actions.

Key responsibilities of the server include provide tools like this:
*   **Executing High-Level Commands:** The server has endpoints like `/move_to/{location}` and `/investigate/{location}`. It contains the necessary logic (e.g., pathfinding, sequences of actions) to execute these commands.
*   **Game State Management:** It provides a comprehensive view of the current game state through the `/tools/get_full_game_state` endpoint.
*   **Abstracting the Game:** It hides the complexity of the underlying game, allowing the agent to interact with the world through a clean, high-level API.

### AI Agent (The "Strategic" Thinker)

The AI agent is now built using the **Google Agents Developer Kit (ADK)**. Its main role is to focus on high-level strategy and decision-making.

Key characteristics of the agent include:
*   **ADK-Powered:** It leverages the ADK to manage the interaction with the language model, including reasoning, planning, and tool use.
*   **High-Level Tools:** The agent's tools are simple functions that make calls to the MCP server's high-level API. For example, it has a `move_to_location` tool that calls the `/move_to/{location}` endpoint on the MCP server.
*   **Goal-Oriented:** The agent's behavior is guided by a comprehensive system prompt that includes its persona, the rules of the order, and the high-level goals defined in `game_data/goals.md`. It decides *what* to do, and the server handles *how* to do it.

This architecture makes the system more modular and robust. The agent can focus on strategy, while the server handles the complex details of game interaction.

## Technologies

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for both the server and the agent.
*   **FastAPI:** A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building the MCP server's API.
*   **Google Agents Developer Kit (ADK):** The framework used to build the AI agent.
*   **Pydantic:** For data validation and settings management.
*   **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.

# Guidelines of the project 

You must need this guidelines and the files are in the docs directory:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   An emulator running "The Abbey of Crime"

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AbadIA-MCP.git
    cd AbadIA-MCP
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure the environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables. You can use the `mcp_config.json` as a reference.


### The emulator of the game must be running

Default configuration is localhost:4477 

You need to define an environment var to point to the emulator: 

export ABADIA_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:4477/"

### Running the MCP Server

To start the MCP server, run the following command:

```bash
.venv/bin/python server/main.py
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Once the MCP server is running and the game is active in the emulator, you can start the AI agent.

```bash
python agent.py
```

The agent will connect to the MCP server, and you will see it start to control the character in the game. The agent's progress and decisions will be logged to the console.
